# Crate Guide

Live site: [https://crate.guide](https://crate.guide)

Crate Guide is a DJ app for finding compatible tracks within your vinyl record collection.

## v2

I have started working on a version 2. The current MongoDB / Express backend will not support future features I would like to build. I have also changed my opinion on document databases since choosing MongoDB.

I am also investigating options for getting basic audio features like BPM and Key for tracks without using the Spotify API. I was unable to have Crate Guide approved by Spotify because you might play a vinyl record whilst using the app which counts as playback from other sources.
